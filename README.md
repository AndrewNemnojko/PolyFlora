<h1>___PolyFlora___</h1>

<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p><strong>PolyFlora</strong> is an API designed for creating a convenient and automated website for selling assembled bouquets and compositions. The main feature and distinction of the project lies in the fact that the cost and availability of bouquets are determined by the constituent elements â€” flowers. When creating or updating a bouquet, as well as changing the cost and quantity of flowers in stock, the price and availability of the bouquet are automatically updated.</p>
<p>This allows for rapid updates to the catalog's contents and keeps it current.</p>
<p>The site also provides users with the ability to authenticate. Access to the admin panel will be restricted to users with the appropriate roles. In the future, an ordering feature is planned.</p>
